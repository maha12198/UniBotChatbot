# UniBot: An Artificial Intelligence Chatbot that is replying to the frequently asked questions in the university.


Developed using Python (Tools: Google Colab). Libraries: JSON, NLTK, Tensorflow, Flask, Twilio. Implemented two GUIs: a Web App (using HTML, CSS, JS, and Python) and WhatsApp Messenger.

Brief Explanation:
Before the beginning of every academic year, prospective applicants of universities face difficulties in getting the information   needed about,  universities.
On the other side, universities also face challenges in improving the user experience and providing 7x24 support. Serving customers without delay is the key to providing a good service in any university.
The exhaustion felt by the university’s Staff, as well as the time and money wasted, contribute to the aggravation of this problem. Quick communication is critical for any university to transform prospective applicants into registered students. Hence, there is a certain need for a system to automate service functions and ease the efforts to overcome this problem. So, An automated Frequently Asked Questions chatbot will be the best solution to overcome this problem.
This project uses Deep Learning to implement an intelligent chatbot to answer university-related FAQs.
UniBot will enable prospective applicants to have an ongoing conversation with UniBot at any time to get answers to most of their queries.
The architecture of UniBot consists of two main components: An NLP Layer, the UniBot Server, and A G U I Layer, the web application.
When the user writes his message and triggers the “Send” button, the app passes the date to the UniBot server. After that, the model classifies to which intent the query belongs to generate the corresponding response. Once the API receives the answer, it passes the answer to the app, which in turn displays it in the chatbox to the user.
UniBot will significantly impact promoting universities for widening the range of prospects and will help reduce the workload, on the university’s staff. Not to mention, the main advantage of UniBot is the 24/7 availability. UniBot will also aid in minimizing the costs since it automates a significant amount of prospective applicants which reduces the number of staff members, needed in a university.
